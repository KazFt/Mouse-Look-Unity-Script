# Mouse-Look-Unity-Script
//This is a Unity Script (C#), this script is able for you to look around.


**As you can see in the MouseLook.cs, there is a function call, Public Class MouseLook : Monobehaviour, and you wanna change the "MouseLook" name to your file name,
or it might not work.**

//You will also do some changes with your Unity Hierarchy.
